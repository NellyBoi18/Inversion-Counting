# Inversion Counting
Implements an optimal algorithm for inversion counting in Java. Is efficient and implemented in O(n logn) time, where n is the number of elements in the ranking.

# Input:
The input will start with an positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. For each instance, there will be a positive integer, giving the number of elements in the ranking.

# Output: 
For each instance, the program outputs the number of inversions for each instance on a seperate line at the end of user input.

# Sample:
**Input:**\
2\
5\
5 4 3 2 1\
4\
1 5 9 8

**Output:**\
10\
1

The sample input has two instances. The first instance has 5 elements and the second has 4.
